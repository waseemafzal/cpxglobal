<p>Achieving positive earned media will further increase your brand’s credibility and visibility amongst key audiences. Inevitably, it will likely increase your book sales and therefore, bottom line. It’s important to remember that people trust and buy into stories they&nbsp;read in the media versus ads they see online or in print magazines.

<p>To be competitive in the global marketplace, organizations need to be driving more innovation in their products and services. They need to innovate rapidly and they need to do it cost-effectively.&nbsp;Organizations today have to work very hard&nbsp;to stay competitive and survive in the marketplace,&nbsp;but just surviving is not good enough. Companies want to grow in size and ultimately grow in value to their shareholders,&nbsp;but the ways of doing that are pretty limited.&nbsp;The only true, sustainable and virtually unlimited source&nbsp;of new growth for any organization is innovation because innovation is about making the world a better place and&nbsp;vital for long-term productivity growth.&nbsp;It is important to have a clear vision of where the company is going, as it will define and set the context for the role innovation will play in enabling profitable growth, help determine the type of innovation you want to drive and the way you need to organize to effect change.</p>

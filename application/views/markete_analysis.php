This section of your plan needs to include an analysis of your key competitors, how they market their services/products, how they differentiate themselves in their marketing efforts, and what kind of market share they possess. We can help you with competitive intelligence for both national and international companies.</li>
	<li>Target Market Analysis:&nbsp;We help you to Identifying and prioritizing specific target markets are another key part of your business plan where research is crucial. You need to think about such questions as: What are the demographics and psychographics of your target customers? How can you best reach them? What kinds of concerns do they have? How do they like to be marketed and sold to?</li>

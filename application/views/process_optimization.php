<p>A system never runs perfect, it is always possible to improve. Improvements can be found in availability (Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and Mean Time between Failures (MTBF)), in maintenance costs, in operator time and involvement, in waste reduction, training of new employees and even in some other areas. CPPEx Global is specialized in improving the performance in system and&nbsp;can help your production process in many ways. We can also facilitate by connecting you to&nbsp;subject matter experts who can&nbsp;work with you on your process, and&nbsp;identify and test alternative&nbsp;equipment which could potentially enhance your production techniques and Identify and define&nbsp;colors &amp; print related issues and requirements.&nbsp;Production process optimization presents new challenges, but it also offers new opportunities&nbsp;based on a process-oriented approach throughout the business processes. For this purpose it is necessary to define process chains across departments instead of thinking in hierarchical department structures. &nbsp;Our experts work with customer team for effective process optimization by using the variety of approaches like Lean Management, Kaizen, Six Sigma, TQM &ndash; total quality management including Mind maps, Fish Bone, DMAIC, Muda, and Value Stream Mapping that focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. These innovative approaches that aimed to help organizations fundamentally re-think how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. These help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes.</p>

<p>The aim of process optimization is to &ldquo;eliminate loss and waste in production&rdquo;, or perhaps &ldquo;bring production up to the optimum level&rdquo; is the better wording. Process management makes an important contribution to production efficiency by significantly enhancing process performance (equipment utilization, yield, product quality, and availability, safety and delivery performance) and reducing cost (energy consumption, raw material consumption, inventory levels, human resources and capital resources.</p>
